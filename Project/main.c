 *******************************************************************************
 * NOTE 1: The Win32 port is a simulation (or is that emulation?) only!  Do not
 * expect to get real time behaviour from the Win32 port or this demo
 * application.  It is provided as a convenient development and demonstration
 * test bed only.  This was tested using Windows XP on a dual core laptop.
 *
 * Windows will not be running the FreeRTOS simulator threads continuously, so
 * the timing information in the FreeRTOS+Trace logs have no meaningful units.
 * See the documentation page for the Windows simulator for an explanation of
 * the slow timing:
 * http://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-Windows-Simulator-Emulator-for-Visual-Studio-and-Eclipse-MingW.html
 * - READ THE WEB DOCUMENTATION FOR THIS PORT FOR MORE INFORMATION ON USING IT -
 *
 * NOTE 2:  This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style
 * project, and a more comprehensive test and demo application.  The
 * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY setting in main.c is used to select
 * between the two.  See the notes on using mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY
 * in main.c.  This file implements the comprehensive test and demo version.
 *
 * NOTE 3:  This file only contains the source code that is specific to the
 * basic demo.  Generic functions, such FreeRTOS hook functions, are defined in
 * main.c.
 *******************************************************************************
 *
 * main() creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.
 * The web documentation provides more details of the standard demo application
 * tasks, which provide no particular functionality but do provide a good
 * example of how to use the FreeRTOS API.
 *
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks and tests are
 * defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * "Check" task - This only executes every five seconds but has a high priority
 * to ensure it gets processor time.  Its main function is to check that all the
 * standard demo tasks are still operational.  While no errors have been
 * discovered the check task will print out "OK" and the current simulated tick
 * time.  If an error is discovered in the execution of a task then the check
 * task will print out an appropriate error message.
